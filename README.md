# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Implementation

This project implements the Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors (wkNN) and standard K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithms to classify data from the NSL-KDD dataset. It includes functionalities to preprocess the data, evaluate the algorithms using cross-validation, and visualize the performance using ROC curves.

## Features

- Preprocesses the NSL-KDD dataset.
- Implements kNN and weighted kNN algorithms.
- Evaluates algorithms using cross-validation.
- Visualizes performance with ROC curves.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - arff
  - matplotlib
